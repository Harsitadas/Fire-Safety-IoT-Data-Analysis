A Fire Alarm System alerts individuals when smoke, fire, carbon monoxide, or other fire-related or general emergencies are detected. These alarms can be triggered automatically by smoke detectors and heat detectors or manually via devices such as manual call points or pull stations. The alarms may consist of motorized bells or wall-mountable sounders or horns. Additionally, they can be speaker strobes that emit an alarm followed by a voice evacuation message, instructing people inside the building not to use the elevators. Fire alarm sounders can be set to specific frequencies and tones, including low, medium, and high, depending on the country and the manufacturer. Most fire alarm systems in Europe sound like a siren with alternating frequencies. In the United States and Canada, fire alarm electronic devices are known as horns and can either be continuous or set to different codes. Fire alarm warning devices can also be adjusted to different volume levels.
